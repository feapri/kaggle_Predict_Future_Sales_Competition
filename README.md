# kaggle Predict Future Sales Competition


A forecast using numpy.polyfit for kaggle's  Predict Future Sales Competition
Three forecasts are created using different degrees to evaluate and compare the results.

When submitted to kaggle, the forecast files scored as follows:
degree 1: 3.05723
degree 2: 3.49631
degree 3: 5.21517

These are not the optimal values, however this book exemplifies how to use numpy polyfit as a formula in an effor to fit the given points.

The data set is challenging and different considerations are to be made before forecasting.
